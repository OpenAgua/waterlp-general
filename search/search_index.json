Functions \u00b6 Overview \u00b6 Data input as Python code are evaluated either once at the beginning of a model run, or on a per-time step basis, depending on whether the fundamental variable data type is fixed (array, scalar, or descriptor) or temporally variable (time series), respectively. The last line of the user-entered code is automatically prepended with \"return \", such that the user doesn't need to. This is most useful for simple cases, such as a constant value. However, the evaluator also automatically detects the presence of a \"return \" in the last line, such that the user may also include a return as desired. So return x on the last line is the same as x . In many cases, including return is simply a matter of personal preference. But this is particularly useful if a return is nested in the last part of a conditional statement. To demonstrate, the following three versions of code input yield the exact same result when evaluated: if date.month in [6,7,8]: x = 0.5 else: x = 1 x if date.month in [6,7,8]: x = 0.5 else: x = 1 return x if date.month in [6,7,8]: return 0.5 else: return 1 This scheme enables the user to import, enter custom functions directly into the code, etc. In the future, this will also enable offering a range of custom Python functions (Check Writing Functions ). It will also allow the user to create, store, re-use, and share custom functions. The last three examples above should raise a question: where does \"date\" come from? OpenAgua will include several built-in variables available for use. For now, this only includes the date of the function call. In the future, however, this will expand to include others as needed.","title":"Data input methods"},{"location":"data-input/#data-input","text":"Data may be input either directly in the form of fundamental data types of time series , array , scalar , or descriptor (text), or indirectly via Python-based functions.","title":"Data input"},{"location":"data-input/#functions","text":"","title":"Functions"},{"location":"data-input/#overview","text":"Data input as Python code are evaluated either once at the beginning of a model run, or on a per-time step basis, depending on whether the fundamental variable data type is fixed (array, scalar, or descriptor) or temporally variable (time series), respectively.

Demand sites include: Industrial facilities, irrigation or agriculture districs, municipal sectors, ecological flow requirements, hydropower plants etc. Supply Resources Resources that provide water supply for demand sites. A supply system is formed by diverse water bodies like catchments, rivers, aquifers and reservoirs connected by conveyances, delivery links and return flows. Catchments Defined area or basin where surface water from precipitation, melting snow and ice accumulation gets collected by natural landscape into another water body. Reservoirs An open storage area where water is collected by a catchment or by artificial transfer of water. Miscellaneous sources Any other sources that provide water to demand sites it can be unconnected rivers, artificial recharge aquifers, pools etc. Rivers and Diversions Natural flowing watercourse which have a head-flow and an end-flow point. Diversions are nodes that divert water from a river into a canal for example. Flow Requirement The minimum amount of water flow in a stream to meet ecological requirements. Conveyance Conveyances are delivery links that transport water from a withdrawal node (surface water, miscellaneous water and groundwater) to a demand point. Delivery Link Distribution or transmission links that deliver water from any supply resources to demand sites. Return Flow Representation of return flows or unused water from demand sites which are delivered to any water body, irrigation crop or a waste water treatment plant for example. Reservoir Elements \u00b6 Priority Condition of preference on demand sites to allocate water. Priority ranges from 0, the lowest priority up to \u221e the highest. The demand site with higher priority will have delivered water first, after it fullfill its need, delivery water will be continued to the second highest priority and so on. Initial Storage The amount of water initially stored at the beginning of a defined period of time. Maximum Outflow Maximum amount of water that can be withdrawn, discharge or pumped from a reservoir or aquifer. Storage Capacity The total amount of available water capacity in an aquifer or reservoir. Conservation Pool The reservoir's active storage, this is the volume of water between the inactive pool and the flood control zone. The conservation pool can be released to supply water demands. Inactive Pool The inactive pool of a reservoir refers to the zone which is normally not drained and it allows sedimentation processes and an ecological area for fish and wildlife. Volume Elevation Curve Relationship between elevation and volume. Local Accretions Reservoir sediment accumulation. Net Evaporation Evaporation rate that occurss in reservoirs after evapotranspiration from natural system and precipitation has occured.
